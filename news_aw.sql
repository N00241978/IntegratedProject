She had led a campaign at her secondary school to allow girls to wear trousers. She told school management it was unfair that girls should be cold.</p><p>Brenda was also a talented GAA player and made the Tyrone minor and senior panels.</p><p>\"She had great potential, as I was told by many, and I often wondered how far she would have went,\" Mary\'s statement said.</p><p>\"Tyrone ladies went on to win the All Ireland in 2018. Would she have been part of that set up? Would she have walked the Hogan Stand steps to lift the All-Ireland trophy?\"</p><p>A number of other club and county competitions were named in Brenda\'s honour. One of the trophies was won by a niece of Brenda\'s in later years, and the team brought the cup to Brenda\'s graveside in tribute.</p><p>Mary said the murder of Brenda had affected generations of her family.

How can a child comprehend that?</p><p>\"And when the older ones come of age and learn the truth and begin to ask questions of why, we relive it all over again.\"</p><p>Mary also questioned whether her cancer would have been caught earlier if her only daughter had still been alive and whether it had been brought on by the stress of her murder</p><p>She spoke about how she had cleared her daughter\'s \"messy\" room. She said she had bagged everything up \"even the rubbish on the floor\" and put it in the attic.</p><p>\"Everything and anything she had ever owned or even touched. It\'s still in the attic. I couldn\'t bear to look at it.\"</p><p>The family say they never released a picture of Brenda and the ones in public circulation had not been issued by them.</p><p>A statement by the mother of 17-year-old Jolene Marlow was also read to the inquiry by a legal representative.</p><p>Bridie Marlow said her daughter, who was the eldest of five children, was academically talented and an excellent sportsperson.</p><p>Shortly before she was murdered in the bombing she had helped her club win their first ever county title.</p><p>She wanted to be a sports psychotherapist and was about to begin a course of study in Belfast.</p><p>\"We always secretly dreaded the thought of Jolene being in Belfast in case the Troubles would flare up,\" her mother said.</p><p>\"Little did we know then that our home town of Omagh, where Jolene had attended school, had a part-time job, was learning to drive, socialised and shopped, would be the actual place where she would be denied all her hopes and dreams of her bright future.\"</p><p>The family of Bryan McCrory was remembered in a statement by his daughter Louise, who described him as a \"gentle giant\" with a \"beautiful open smile that made you feel safe\".</p><p>She told the inquiry how his children had gone to his grave on the morning of their weddings \"to be able to share a part of the day with him\".</p><p>Instead of his presence at the wedding celebrations, they had a picture of their father on the table.</p><p>\"It\'s impossible to explain how important he was to all of us and how much his presence was and is missed in our daily family life,\" she said.</p><p>He loved to take pictures and had gone to Omagh the day of the bombing to leave in films to be developed.</p><p>He was described as a natural with children with whom he had a great affinity.</p><p>The family had missed out on the simple pleasure of \"just being together\".</p><p>\"We have missed out on so many things post 15 August 1998 as a family,\" Louise said.</p><p>\"Our family events are overshadowed by an immeasurable loss and always a constant awareness of a missing husband, father, and friend. Our gentle giant.\"</p><p>She said he was much more than a name on a list or a face in a collage of beautiful faces of those who died in the bombing.</p><p>Over the last two weeks, family members of the 29 victims have been giving an account of their loved ones to the inquiry, setting out the scale of the devastation caused by the bombing and their sense of loss.</p><p>Yesterday, Michael Gallagher, who was driving force in the establishment of the public inquiry, gave evidence about his 21-year-old son Aiden.</p><p>In the course of his evidence, he said the Real IRA bombers had been \"freedom takers\" rather than the freedom fighters they had presented themselves as.</p>', 'images/1_Omagh.webp', 1, 1, 1, '2025-03-10 14:50:55', '2025-02-25 16:30:00'),

But she was uninterested in being the exception. When I interviewed her on the occasion of her 2023 exhibition at the Whitney Museum of American Art, which was the first retrospective of a Native artist organized by that institution, she acknowledged that her show was “breaking a barrier, opening a door, a crack.” In the next breath, she said that she hoped “others will now come behind me.”</p><p></p><p>Jaune Quick-to-See Smith, Artist With an Indigenous Focus, Dies at 85</p><p>Feb. 1, 2025</p><p>Despite her modesty, there’s no question that Smith was unique. She was an expressive painter and avid collagist; she borrowed and drew on ancient petroglyphs, Native beadwork, Joan Mitchell’s paintings and Robert Rauschenberg’s combines, to name just a few influences. She used Indigenous imagery like the canoe and the buffalo the way Warhol used soup cans and Marilyn Monroe. In doing so, Smith claimed their status as national symbols — reminding us that the roots of America are Native.</p><p>Advertisement</p><p>SKIP ADVERTISEMENT</p><p>Interconnectedness was a principle that underpinned her life and work. It came from her Salish heritage: born in Montana on the Flathead Reservation, she was an enrolled member of the Confederated Salish and Kootenai Nation. Smith’s father was a horse trader, and she spoke often about seeing herself in his lineage. She was “into educational trading, intellectual trading, while my father was into horse-trading, and my grandmothers ran mule-drawn salt trains into Canada to trade with the Métis/Cree peoples,” she explained in an interview for the Whitney catalog. “It all was and is about sharing beneficial goods or properties to make others’ lives better, but reciprocally we benefit, too. That is our cultural mandate.”</p><p>For Smith that meant teaching, lecturing, and writing encouraging notes to fellow artists; it also meant organizing collectives, fund-raising campaigns and exhibitions. She didn’t ask for permission to do these things, nor did she always know how she was going to go about them. Instead, she adopted a phrase that her father used to say: “When the spirit moves me.”</p><p>Editors’ Picks</p><p>4 Pilates Tips for Beginners</p><p>What Testosterone Can, and Can’t, Do for Women After Menopause</p><p>These California Olives Are Unique and Delicious.

As Smith told it, not long after she joined the board of trustees for the Institute of American Indian Arts, a school for Native Americans, she began to fear that the federal Bureau of Indian Affairs, which operated the institute, would close it.</p><p>So she flew to Washington, D.C., where she managed to connect with a congressional staff member who wrote legislation to turn the institute into a nonprofit. It was then introduced as an amendment to a House education bill. Smith helped organize a letter-writing campaign in support of the bill, which passed in 1986. The institute still exists today.</p><p>Advertisement</p><p>SKIP ADVERTISEMENT</p><p>If this sounds like a hero’s tale, it isn’t. Smith was so humble it could be almost vexing, given how much she accomplished in her life. She narrated her stories matter-of-factly, using them as illustrative rather than to boast.

And it’s true that her paintings, with their earthy palette, as well as her prints and sculptures, can seem like outliers in the flourishing landscape of contemporary Native art, where many practitioners are riffing on Indigenous forms or new media rather than Western modernism. But Smith’s art has a force to it. It’s urgent, and its gaze is unflinching.</p><p>Smith’s messages could be harsh, as in a series of paintings she did after 9/11 and the United States’ invasion of Iraq: “The King of the Mountain” (2005) depicts several national flags, including the American flag, planted in a pile of skulls, bodies and debris. But they could also be hopeful: a decade later, that mountain became a platform for the powerful female leader in “The Speaker” (2015) to stand on. To me, though, Smith’s messages are strongest when they’re humorous — and she could be wickedly so. She laughed easily in conversation and frequently portrayed and invoked the figure of coyote, a teacher and trickster in Salish mythology, in her work.</p>', 'images/3_Jaune.png', 3, 3, 3, '2025-03-10 14:50:55', '2025-02-21 09:55:44'),

The windows, the ministry said, would fill six of the seven chapels on the side of the nave, joining one figurative window in one of the chapels that would remain. Officials said the commission was not to replace anything that had been lost, but to give the cathedral a flavor of the contemporary gesture that had been promised in the wake of the fire.</p><p>Preservationists lodged vociferous objections, in part because the windows being replaced — from the 19th-century renovation orchestrated by Eugène Emmanuel Viollet-le-Duc — had survived the fire.

Because there’s nothing bigger, more historic or incredible.”</p><p>Tabouret grew up in the South of France and knew even as a child that she wanted to be a painter. She fed her interest with books filled with 19th-century landscapes. And around the time she turned 18, she took the train to Paris, where she was admitted to the venerated École des Beaux-Arts.</p><p>She visited New York as an exchange student at the Cooper Union before heading back to Paris, where she modeled for art classes, worked as a telemarketer and waited tables to stay afloat. One day in 2013, the French billionaire businessman and collector François Pinault noticed one of her paintings, she said. He bought all of her work at the show. “The next morning my life was different,” she said.</p><p>A little more than a year later, she moved to Los Angeles, where she quickly discovered one of of the city’s core charms: “That feeling that you can be in a town, but also be very solitary,” she said.</p><p>Image</p><p>Credit...Tag Christof for The New York Times</p><p>Since then, much of her work has been filled with figures: sometimes miners, sometimes wrestlers, sometimes children (who are sometimes in groups and sometimes wearing makeup), sometimes young women and sometimes herself. Her figures are often filled with “body language” and “inside feelings,” as she put it, and they have been exhibited in Paris, Los Angeles, London, Tokyo and elsewhere. A painting of young debutantes in blue dresses sold at auction for $870,000 in 2021, and several of her other works have also sold for hundreds of thousands of dollars.</p><p>Advertisement</p><p>SKIP ADVERTISEMENT</p><p>“Claire has always kind of taken from her personal life as she creates her paintings. But they transcend her personal narrative,” said Davida Nemeroff, the owner of Night Gallery in Los Angeles, which will host an exhibition of Tabouret’s new work (“Moonlight Shadow”) from Feb. 15 to March 29. “We can all see ourselves in the paintings, which I think is why they’re so powerful and also why I think she’s such great candidate to do the Notre-Dame project.”</p><p>Tabouret, whose dark sweater and jeans were splattered with paint on a recent weekday, knows that some stiffly oppose her new work replacing cherished windows.</p><p>But she considers herself a researcher at heart. And she knows Notre-Dame’s history. She notes that it was built long before the 19th century, when the last renovation (which preservationists embrace) occurred. And even at its founding hundreds of years earlier, a church at the site was purposely destroyed so its stones could be used to build something better.</p><p>Image</p><p>Credit...Tag Christof for The New York Times</p><p>“The idea of using and reusing and transforming is part of the history of this building,” she said. “Each renovation does modify what was before. So it would be kind of weird to freeze it in time.”</p><p>“We have to trust our art,” she added, “the same way every century before us trusted our artists.”</p><p>A committee running the competition Tabouret ultimately won gave the final eight contenders a specific assignment with specific parameters: Paint the Pentecost. Each large window, with its many panels, must represent one sentence from the Bible; follow the story; make it figurative work; when considering colors, respect the beautiful, neutral white light; whatever you make should be easily understood.</p><p>Advertisement</p><p>SKIP ADVERTISEMENT</p><p>In Tabouret’s Los Angeles studio, her vibrant sketches of each of the six windows were displayed on the wall and on the floor. They were accompanied by pieces that zoomed in on some of the human faces offering a life-size, more detailed look at how the work will eventually appear inside the cathedral.</p><p>She had made her work on plexiglass. And then, using a press, Tabouret created the prints on paper of each design. The ink displayed differently on each print, offering insights into color, texture and shadows. “There is an element of unpredictability and surprise,” she said. “Like playing between what you can actually control and what you can’t.”</p><p>Image</p><p>Credit...Tag Christof for The New York Times</p><p>One of the six windows she had sketched depicts “tongues of fire,” Tabouret said. It is the reason officials chose the Pentecost and the passages they did, she said. They wanted to tie the project to the fire that forced the restoration.</p><p>At this, Tabouret took a moment to consider the fires in Los Angeles that have burned not far from her studio and the life she has created here for herself and her family.</p><p>Across the studio, a large painting of a group of children leaned against the wall.

Or will Lamar minimize its role — or even elide it entirely — either out of an abundance of legal precaution, a concession to the event’s corporate partners, or an aversion to sharing the stage, even spiritually, with his enemy?</p><p></p><p>ImageThe rapper Kendrick Lamar, in a denim jacket, jeans, and cap, smiles as he holds a Grammy Award aloft onstage.</p><p>Lamar’s Grammy-winning, inescapable hit was born out of a messy few weeks of back-and-forth with Drake.

It’s bigger than ‘Hit ’Em Up’ ever was, more culturally relevant than ‘Ether’ ever was — it led to an unprecedented lawsuit from the person that it was targeted at.”</p><p></p><p>“There’s a difference between hit records and anthems,” he added. “You can think about a lot of hit records, but how many cultural anthems are there that transcend race, the genre of music, region, anything? Not many. ‘Not Like Us’ is a cultural anthem. Ironically, it’s going to end up on Kidz Bop.”</p><p></p><p>It’s not that Lamar hasn’t had a big song before. Tracks like “Humble” and “All the Stars,” with SZA, who is scheduled to appear at the Super Bowl as a special guest ahead of a joint tour, are both popular and recognizable, each topping two billion plays on Spotify.</p><p></p><p>But it’s worth recalling where Lamar seemed headed before he and Drake goaded one another into battle: deeper inward.</p><p></p><p>An underground mixtape artist until his lauded major-label debut, “good kid, m.A.A.d city,” revitalized L.A. gangster rap in 2012, Lamar favored complexity on the jazzy, searching follow-up, “To Pimp a Butterfly,” in 2015, before balancing storytelling and commercial hitmaking on “Damn.,” which went on to win the Pulitzer for music in 2018.</p><p></p><p>Image</p><p>An older man in a dark blue suit and tie is onstage shaking hands with a younger man who is dressed more casually and holds a bound award in his other hand.</p><p>The typically introspective Lamar, with a Pulitzer Prize on his mantel, has made a career of questioning and reinforcing his own high-minded reputation. His chart-topping diss track represents a swerve.Credit...Bebeto Matthews/Associated Press</p><p>His 2022 release, “Mr. Morale & the Big Steppers,” however, was a concept album about therapy, trauma and healing that earned Lamar the lowest sales and streams of his mainstream career. When not on tour, he tended to lie low, ducking most any spotlight.</p><p></p><p>Advertisement</p><p></p><p>SKIP ADVERTISEMENT</p><p></p><p>Last March, when he resurfaced with a boisterous, targeted guest verse on “Like That,” by Future and Metro Boomin, Lamar was hinting at something different. (He had famously poked the proverbial hip-hop bear back in 2013, with a verse on Big Sean’s “Control,” in which Lamar called out rappers by name, including Drake, as lackluster competition.)</p><p></p><p>But it wasn’t until the heart of his back-and-forth with Drake, in which Lamar released four diss tracks in five days — culminating in the knockout blow of “Not Like Us” — that the rapper flipped his public persona and reputation as a somewhat reluctant hitmaker.</p><p></p><p>Elliott Wilson, the journalist and podcaster who previously edited XXL Magazine, called it something of a “career reset — he built mystique, but now he just feels like more ‘man of the people.’”</p><p></p><p>Lamar had previously tended to shrug off such a mantle. When “Alright,” from “To Pimp a Butterfly,” became a protest chant, he never leaned into the attention, opting to walk silently and camouflaged in a few protests without commenting on his music’s significance. On “Family Ties,” in 2021, he rapped: “I been duckin’ the social gimmicks / I been duckin’ the overnight activists, yeah / I’m not a trending topic, I’m a prophet.”</p><p></p><p>He has been more eager to fan the flames of “Not Like Us.” At his “Pop Out” concert in Los Angeles on Juneteenth, Lamar performed the song five times in a row, flanked by a coalition of California rappers, athletes, entertainers and others who might otherwise be rivals.</p><p></p><p>Advertisement</p><p></p><p>SKIP ADVERTISEMENT</p><p></p><p>“He breathed new life into the West Coast,” said E-40, the veteran Bay Area rapper who, along with the late L.A. artist Drakeo the Ruler, provides an obvious touchstone for the hyper-regional sound of “Not Like Us.”</p><p></p><p>“I do not recall a song that captured the young, old and in between like that in many years,” he said. “It hit the clubs so tough and they don’t even look at like it’s about Drake.”</p><p></p><p>In the context of last year’s battle, the song’s tribal messaging is a knotty comment on Blackness, regionalism and authenticity from the Compton-born Lamar, addressing a foe who is biracial, Canadian and Jewish (as well as a former child actor). But out in the world, its “us vs. them” ethos has been more widely interpreted.</p><p></p><p>Image</p><p>A man in a red hoodie and jeans performs onstage while bathed in warm light.

He’s not pandering.”</p><p></p><p>Advertisement</p><p></p><p>SKIP ADVERTISEMENT</p><p></p><p>He added, “I don’t believe I’m an angry person. But I do believe in love and war, and I believe they both need to exist.”</p><p></p><p>These themes — and the West Coast bounce of “Not Like Us” — carried over onto “GNX,” the album Lamar released in November, which has spawned hits like “Squabble Up” and “TV Off” that share the pugnaciousness of their spiritual predecessor without the Drake-centric details.</p><p></p><p>Could they stand in for “Not Like Us” at the Super Bowl, maybe after a taste of the diss track’s identifiable beat and unobjectionable chorus? Medleys, after all, are common in the 15-minute slot.</p><p></p><p>“Kendrick really wins if he ignores Drake during the Super Bowl,” said Too Short, another West Coast rap legend. “If he has to address Drake, I think it’s too heavy on his mind.”</p><p></p><p>Charlamagne agreed. “The reality of the situation is, he won the battle. ‘The 48 Laws of Power’ teaches you not to go past the mark you aimed for in victory,” he said. “When you win the Grammy, that’s spiking the football. You already got the Super Bowl — that’s spiking the football. I think there is a point where you gotta put it to bed.”</p><p></p><p>Notably, in his Grammy acceptance speeches, Lamar refrained from even alluding to his song’s subject.</p><p></p><p>Advertisement</p><p></p><p>SKIP ADVERTISEMENT</p><p></p><p>Still, Super Bowl performances have often succeeded with just the right amount of headline-hungry controversy.

He described himself as the type of teen who was way more interested in watching “The September Issue,” the documentary about the inner workings of Vogue.</p><p>Mr. Smith, who was born in Connecticut and raised in Los Angeles, was reflecting on his teenage years over coffee last month at the Hotel Alfred Sommier in Paris. He was in town attending the men’s wear shows for the first time since being named the first-ever fashion editor of the National Football League.</p><p>He started the job last fall with a directive to use fashion and style to reach new audiences through the league’s media platforms. Mr. Smith works with athletes to create and share content — photos or videos of them showcasing their off-duty style at events like men’s fashion week — and helps players and teams build relationships with traditional fashion media brands like GQ and Vogue.</p><p>At Super Bowl LIX on Sunday, he will be part of a team covering what players and other notable attendees wear to the game during a new red-carpet segment that will air as part of the streamer Tubi’s Super Bowl broadcast. When he is not traveling, Mr. Smith, who still lives in Los Angeles, works mostly at the N.F.L.’s West Coast office next to SoFi Stadium in Inglewood, Calif.</p><p></p><p>While the N.B.A., N.H.L., M.L.B. and M.L.S. have also been focusing more attention on athletes’ style as the industries of fashion and sports have become more intertwined, those leagues have yet to underscore that focus by creating a job with the word “fashion” in its title.</p><p>ImageA man in a black baseball cap, center, standing inside a room cluttered with people and racks of clothes.</p><p>In January, Mr. Smith went to the men’s wear shows in Paris, where he visited the showroom of the designer KidSuper.Credit...James Hill for The New York Times</p><p>Image</p><p>Four men standing in front of a white seamless backdrop.</p><p>From left, Colm Dillane, the designer better known as KidSuper, with Marquez Valdes-Scantling of the New Orleans Saints, Ogbo Okoronkwo of the Cleveland Browns and Mr. Smith.Credit...James Hill for The New York Times</p><p>Ian Trombetta, the N.F.L.’s senior vice president of social, influencer and content marketing, described Mr. Smith’s role as that of a consultant “for players, and then ultimately the league, in terms of how we’re showing up in different moments.”</p><p>Though his fashion editor role is new to the N.F.L., Mr. Smith is not. He has worked in different capacities for the league and its associated entities on and off for about six years, including as a stylist to players who have hired him on their own.</p><p></p><p>He is currently styling Joe Burrow, the Cincinnati Bengals’ quarterback, who did not attend the men’s shows in Paris because he had instead gone to the Australian Open in Melbourne. Mr. Smith said he helped Mr. Burrow choose clothes to bring to the tennis tournament, traveling to Mr. Burrow’s home in Ohio with four suitcases full of options.</p><p>Pivotal to Mr. Smith becoming the N.F.L.’s fashion editor was his involvement in getting Mr. Burrow and Justin Jefferson, a Minnesota Vikings wide receiver, to participate in Vogue World, a fashion show on steroids, in Paris last summer, Mr. Trombetta explained.</p><p>“The Paris moment was a way for us to sort of recalibrate what Kyle was doing and formalize some things,” he said, citing a growing desire among N.F.L. players, whose teams sometimes set dress guidelines for off-field appearances, to tell stories through clothes. “Some of them may have really big personalities, and some may actually be a little bit on the shy side, and fashion is their way of expressing themselves.”</p><p>Mr. Smith had previously spent more than two years working as a social media programmer for the N.F.L., a job in which he helped broaden the fashion content posted to the @nfl and @nflstyle Instagram accounts (he still oversees @nflstyle). He also cultivated relationships with clotheshorse athletes: Mr. Smith recalled taking some dozen Cleveland Browns players shopping on Rodeo Drive, for example, while the team was in Los Angeles for a game.</p><p>He got his first job with the league in 2019: After internships with the celebrity stylist Karla Welch and the brand Amiri, Mr. Smith was hired as a wardrobe assistant for the N.F.L. Network. He remembered receiving a callback for the job while driving to a Costco with his father, and joking with him about the irony of the situation given Mr. Smith’s past feelings about sports. “‘Wouldn’t that be so funny?’” he recalled asking his father.</p><p></p><p>These California Olives Are Unique and Delicious.

Showcasing his interest in fashion, he said, helps push back against perceptions of football players as “barbaric men that don’t have any emotions outside of anger.”Credit...James Hill for The New York Times</p><p>Mr. Smith said he applied to the job mainly because it was a chance to pursue work as a stylist, but also because his internships had opened his mind to bringing his interest in fashion to an industry that the style world had yet to fully embrace. “Musicians and actors were covered, athletes needed the same thing,” he said.</p><p>At the N.F.L. Network, Mr. Smith helped dress the anchors; when he joined the company, he said, players’ style and the clothes they wore for tunnel walks were not given much attention. “The anchors would say, ‘Here’s the 10th-best player in the league,’” Mr. Smith said. “They’d talk about his stats, and I would think, ‘Yes, but look at his outfit! Why aren’t they talking about that fit?’”</p><p>He and a fellow wardrobe assistant pitched N.F.L. executives the idea to create an Instagram account documenting players’ style, which was accepted. That account is now defunct, but Mr. Smith said it got the attention of many players, who would reach out about posting photos of their outfits.</p><p>Marquez Valdes-Scantling, a wide receiver for the New Orleans Saints who has played in the N.F.L. since 2018, said opportunities to showcase personal style were appealing to athletes like himself, who are on teams with as many as 53 players and seen mostly in uniforms that include helmets over their faces.</p><p>“We’re so interchangeable,” he said. “You get lost.”</p><p>This season, Mr. Valdes-Scantling’s schedule allowed him to go with Mr. Smith to the men’s fashion week in Paris — it was his first time at the shows. Last year, he founded Luxe Fashion Fest, an event in Tampa, Fla., where Mr. Valdes-Scantling lives, that focuses on emerging brands. (Its second installment is being planned for April.)</p><p></p><p>On a Friday in late January, he and Mr. Smith visited the showroom of the designer Colm Dillane, better known as KidSuper, so that Mr. Valdes-Scantling, 30, could try on some clothes. As a shirtless Mr. Valdes-Scantling slipped his toned and tattooed arms into a navy suit jacket with pale pink streaks, the men wondered what he should wear underneath.</p><p>“I could just wear no shirt,” Mr. Valdes-Scantling said.</p><p>“No shirt is very athlete!” Mr. Smith replied.</p><p></p><p>A parade of models in colorful clothes on the runway.</p><p>Colorful pieces with graphic prints were among the clothes on the runway at KidSuper’s recent show in Paris.

Mr. Okoronkwo, who had just been in Milan for the city’s men’s wear shows, said he started attending fashion weeks in Europe about five years ago. Since then, he added, his style had “shifted from streetwear to more tailored fits.”</p><p>He was drawn to a blazer, but Mr. Smith wondered about the sleeves. “It’s very slim,” he said. “Your arms wouldn’t fit.”</p><p></p><p></p><p>Mr. Smith had said earlier that he thought Mr. Okoronkwo was one of the best-dressed players on what he considered to be the most fashionable team in the N.F.L.</p><p>“You’d think it would be a New York or Los Angeles or maybe Miami team — it’s Cleveland,” he said, naming Denzel Ward, Grant Delpit and Jeremiah Owusu-Koramoah, who is known for wearing traditional Ghanaian ensembles, as being among the Browns’s style-forward players.</p><p>The day after Mr. Smith and the players had the fitting at KidSuper’s showroom, he met Mr. Valdes-Scantling and Mr. Okoronkwo for the designer’s nighttime runway show at the Parc de la Villette, a sprawling park at the northeastern edge of Paris.</p><p>Mr. Smith, who was wearing Maison Margiela Tabi boots, had to muscle his way through a crowd to get in. “Fashion is a sport!” he said.</p><p>After the show, Mr. Okoronkwo credited Mr. Smith for being “a bridge” to the fashion world — a world that Mr. Okoronkwo said he once viewed the same way Mr. Smith had seen the world of sports: not very welcoming.</p><p>“It was a problem before if you were into anything but grass, football and dirt,” Mr. Okoronkwo said. “But my love of fashion and photography only helps my game. It’s finally normal for football players to like fashion.”</p>', 'images/6_NFL.webp', 6, 3, 4, '2025-03-10 14:50:55', '2025-02-27 15:59:07');

(7, '25 Years Ago, Joan Didion Kept a Diary. It’s About to Become Public.', 'Joan Didion\'s private diary, written 25 years ago, is set to be released to the public.', '<p>In December 1999, around her 65th birthday, Joan Didion started writing a journal after sessions with her psychiatrist. Over the next year or so, she kept notes about their conversations, which covered her struggles with anxiety, guilt and depression, her sometimes fraught relationship with her daughter, and her thoughts about her work and legacy.</p><p>Shortly after Didion’s death in 2021, her three literary trustees found the diary while going through her papers in her Manhattan apartment. There were 46 entries stashed an unlabeled folder and addressed to her husband, John Gregory Dunne.</p><p>Didion left no instructions about how to handle the journal after her death, and no one in her professional orbit knew of its existence. But her trustees — her literary agent Lynn Nesbit, and two of her longtime editors, Shelley Wanger and Sharon DeLano — saw that she had printed and stored them in chronological order. The notes formed a complete narrative, one that seemed more intimate and unfiltered than anything she had published.</p><p>On April 22, Didion’s journal will be published by Knopf as a 208-page book, “Notes to John.” Other than correcting typos and adding occasional footnotes for context, the pages will be published exactly as they were found, according to the Didion Dunne Literary Trust. The originals will also be available to the public and scholars as part of Didion and Dunne’s joint archives, which the New York Public Library will open to the public on March 26, 2025.</p><p></p><p>“Notes to John” marks the first publication of new material by Didion since she stopped releasing new work in 2011, a decade before her death.</p><p>This is the cover of “Notes to John,” by Joan Didion.</p><p>Jordan Pavlin, Knopf’s publisher and editor in chief, described the journal as “a moving and profound record of a life of ferocious intellectual engagement,” and as a raw, vulnerable account from a writer who was acutely conscious of her public image.</p><p>“It fills in great gaps in our understanding of her thinking,” Pavlin said. “Didion’s art has always derived part of its electricity from what she reveals and what she withholds,” she continued. “‘Notes to John’ is unique in its lack of elision.”</p><p>The release of Didion’s post-therapy notes as a discrete literary work will likely raise questions about whether she would have approved of the project. Since she kept the papers carefully organized and filed in a small cabinet next to her desk, she likely anticipated that they would be gathered in her archives and read by the public and scholars.</p><p></p><p>But Didion, who had published plenty of personal and intimate writing, didn’t tell her agent or publisher about the pages, or seek to have them published during her lifetime. And she occasionally expressed disapproval of literary estates’ impulses to put out every last scrap of a famous author’s work.</p><p>In a 1998 essay about the release of a posthumous novel by Ernest Hemingway, a writer she idolized, Didion cast the publication as a betrayal of the author’s wishes. “You think something is in shape to be published or you don’t, and Hemingway didn’t,” she wrote.</p><p>Throughout her life and even in death, Didion remained an enigmatic figure, revered for her elusive, skeptical demeanor and her chiseled, penetrating prose. She rose to fame chronicling the turbulent cultural upheaval of the 1960s and ’70s, which she captured in groundbreaking essays that were collected in works like “Slouching Towards Bethlehem” and “The White Album.”</p><p>She also wrote extensively, often with the same cool detachment, about herself. She revealed her mental health struggles, back when such disclosures were rare, and included excerpts from her own psychiatric evaluation in the title essay of “The White Album,” which described how, in 1968, an attack of vertigo and nausea left her feeling unmoored.</p><p>Later in her career, she explored the aftermath of personal tragedies. In her blockbuster memoir “The Year of Magical Thinking,” she described the shock and dislocation she felt following the sudden death of her husband in 2003.</p><p>That book was followed by a second memoir, “Blue Nights,” describing her grief after her adopted daughter Quintana Roo Dunne, who suffered from alcohol addiction, died in 2005 at age 39 of acute pancreatitis. In “Blue Nights,” Didion wrote about her anxieties concerning motherhood and aging, and her fear that writing no longer came to her as easily as it once did.</p><p>Didion addresses many of those same themes in the writing collected in “Notes to John,” according to her trustees and publisher. The early entries describe sessions in which she discussed her feelings about adoption, alcoholism and the complexities of her relationship with Quintana.</p><p>In later notes, she reveals conversations about her childhood and her distant relationship with her parents, her struggles to write and her reflections on her literary legacy. Didion addresses Dunne directly in her notes, and refers to conversations she had with him about her sessions.</p><p>When Didion died in December 2021 at age 87, she left behind copious records of her life and work. Her archives, together with Dunne’s, arrived at the New York Public Library in 354 boxes, which include photographs, letters, research material, dinner party menus, datebooks, manuscripts and family material.</p><p>There are no immediate plans to publish more material from her archives, though it will take time to assess it all, said Paul Bogaards, a spokesperson for the Didion Dunne Literary Trust.</p><p></p><p>The diaries that make up “Notes to John” stood out as “an important contribution to the posthumous view of Didion’s work,” Bogaards said.</p><p>“It stands alone as a narrative,” he said. “There is nothing else like it in her archive.”</p>', 'images/7_Joan.webp', 7, 3, 3, '2025-03-10 14:50:55', '2025-02-27 17:30:05'),

Gaza is not a place for people to be living, and the only reason they want to go back - and I believe this strongly - is because they have no alternative,\" he said.</p><p></p><p>Later, he said that wealthy nations in the region could finance the resettlement and find Gazans \"a good, fresh, beautiful piece of land\".</p><p></p><p>\"I would think that they would be thrilled,\" he said.</p><p></p><p>He was repeatedly asked if he would force Palestinians to relocate even if they did not want to.</p><p></p><p>\"I don’t think they’re going to tell me no,\" he said.</p><p></p><p>A voluntary movement of Gazans would not constitute ethnic cleansing, but the US President\'s statement seems like wishful thinking.</p><p></p><p>So far, Palestinians have roundly rejected the relocation plan. And, during the Bosnian war, perpetrators of ethnic cleansing often portrayed their actions as voluntary relocations by the victims.</p><p></p><p>As such, Mr Trump\'s voluntary defence wouldn\'t necessarily rule out ethnic cleansing.</p><p></p><p>How would the plan be carried out?</p><p></p><p>Of course, Hamas has already objected to the proposal. Senior Hamas official Sami Abu Zuhri said that Mr Trump\'s proposed relocation was \"a recipe for creating chaos and tension in the region\".</p><p></p><p>The Palestinian ambassador to Ireland, Jilan Wahba Abdalmajid, told RTÉ’s Morning Ireland that no one on earth could uproot the Palestinian people from their land.</p><p></p><p>\"We belong there, and we will remain there\", she said. \"This is our land, and we will defend it and defend our legitimate right to be there\", she added.</p><p></p><p>In other words, it is very unlikely that Palestinians will leave Gaza voluntarily. If the US is going to \"take over\" the territory as President Trump said, it would almost certainly require a huge military deployment.</p><p></p><p></p><p>Protesters gather outside the US embassy in Seoul, South Korea to denounced the Trump plan</p><p>That would constitute the most expansive commitment of US forces in the Middle East since the invasion and reconstruction of Iraq two decades ago.</p><p></p><p>And it would be an incredible about-turn for a president who famously opposed the invasion of Iraq and vowed that the US would become less involved in global conflicts under his watch.</p><p></p><p>Egypt, Jordan and Saudi Arabia already rejected the notion of relocating Palestinians to their countries. In a joint statement, they said the transfer of Palestinians from their land would threaten stability in the region and undermine peace.</p><p></p><p>Mr Trump addressed this in his press conference. \"They say they’re not going to accept,\" he announced. \"I say they will.\"</p><p></p><p>How exactly he imposes his will on the region remains to be seen.</p><p></p><p>What does this mean for the ceasefire?</p><p></p><p>One of the premises of Benjamin Netanyahu\'s trip to Washington was to discuss the second phase of the ceasefire deal for Gaza.</p><p></p><p>The agreement outlined that negotiations for the second phase of the deal would begin on the 16th day.</p><p></p><p>Today is day 18 of the ceasefire.</p><p></p><p>The second phase is due to see the remainder of the Israeli hostages held by Hamas released and oversee a full Israeli troop withdrawal from Gaza.</p><p></p><p></p><p>Displaced Palestinians continue to return to their homes in the north of Gaza</p><p>If the US plans to occupy Gaza, surely US troops would need to be on the ground before any full withdrawal by the Israelis. Given the complexity of such an operation, this could potentially delay any Israeli troop withdrawal from the enclave.</p><p></p><p>In President Joe Biden\'s final address, he said the ceasefire would remain in place until the details of the second phase are finalised, even if that takes it beyond the initial six-week truce.</p><p></p><p>At the very least, the announcement will complicate discussions as Hamas officials are unlikely to give concessions with a plan like this on the table.</p>', 'images/8_Trump_Gaza.jpg', 8, 2, 5, '2025-03-10 14:50:55', '2025-02-25 14:00:55'),
(9, 'The Sims Turned Players Into Gods. And Farmers. And Vampires. And Landlords.', 'The Sims allowed players to become everything from gods to vampires, shaping lives and landscapes.', '<p>Will Wright kindly requests that admirers stop describing him as a god.</p><p>“I don’t think God would concern himself with taking out the trash and cleaning the toilet,” he quipped while chain-smoking cigarettes. Besides, he’s an atheist.</p><p>But what is better shorthand to describe the man who created The Sims? The influential video game allowed players to act like gods themselves, building virtual neighborhoods populated by virtual families who pay virtual bills and complete virtual chores.</p><p>Players could improve the lives of their Sims by constructing McMansions filled with plush couches and flat-screen televisions. Or they could become vengeful, directing Sims to light fireworks indoors and paddle to exhaustion in a swimming pool with no exit.</p><p>Twenty-five years later, players are continuing to push the boundaries. Sure, there are glitzy houses and happy families in The Sims 4. But by modifying the game’s code, players have created a health care system as byzantine as the real American one and taught Sims how to wield pistols and knives. The game’s official expansion packs offer their own weirdness. Sims can become vampires and witches. They can even play The Sims.</p><p>“I never really thought of The Sims as inherently optimistic,” Wright, 65, said. “I always thought of The Sims as slightly sarcastically nostalgic for a past that never really existed.”</p><p>The Sims was a sandbox for the American dream when it was released on Feb. 4, 2000, with Wright pulling inspiration from biology, architecture, comics and psychology to dictate the rules of his virtual dollhouse. It was an unusual proposal at a time when most games were goal-oriented and linear, and a predecessor to create-your-own-adventure games like Minecraft that give players a pick axe and carte blanche.</p><p>Although more than 500 million people have played games in the Sims franchise, which is particularly popular with women, it was originally seen as a risk. Executives at the game studio Maxis had urged Wright to focus instead on the SimCity franchise, his urban-planning simulator from 1989 that had put the company at the forefront of American game design. “Everyone in the room hated the idea of The Sims,” Wright recalled.</p><p>The outlook initially worsened after Electronic Arts acquired Maxis in 1997. Some managers wanted the game to be less realistic; others wanted to prevent it from being released at all.</p><p>But other leaders saw promise in Wright’s vision. “We wanted to make SimCity bigger,” said Luc Barthelet, who was then an Electronic Arts executive and brought in key resources for The Sims’s development team. “But we also needed to invest in designers like Will who were extremely talented and doing things that were different.”</p><p></p><p>Claire Curtin, who helped invent Simlish, a gibberish language spoken by the game’s characters, said developers refined its social system by imbuing the Sims with needs like hunger, comfort and hygiene. Neglecting those needs could lead to starvation, anxiety attacks and bladder problems.</p><p>“When I joined there wasn’t really any social game between the Sims,” she said. “There was no love; there certainly was no woohoo,” she said, using an in-game euphemism for sex.</p><p>The final product included the hierarchy of needs — and a lot of shopping.</p><p>The Sims was a satirical take on American consumerism. Wright echoed the grandiose claims of postwar advertising in the game’s furniture catalog, which offered Sims toasters and chairs that promised to change their lives. There was often a correlation between the price paid for an item and how much it would improve a Sim’s mood.</p><p>“You buy all these things,” he explained. “Fridges and TVs. And all these things promise to make you happy. But at some point they all start breaking down. They become hidden time bombs.”</p><p>The Sims were poorly equipped to handle those catastrophes. When a stove caught fire, the entire family would run into the kitchen to scream in terror. They would often allow themselves to be engulfed in flames instead of reaching for an extinguisher. And once the Grim Reaper arrived to replace their bodies with urns, the game had essentially ended.</p><p>Each disaster was carefully engineered. “In early versions of the game, the autonomy was too good,” Wright said. “Almost anything the player did was worse than the Sims running on autopilot.” So he infused his simulation with a little chaos to make players feel like anything could happen. Even guinea pigs, introduced as low-maintenance pets, might accidentally bite a character and leave them with a deadly disease.</p><p>Wright wanted players to feel like they were gods controlling stupid ants when, in reality, they were actually ants pretending to be gods. Even the cheat codes that could change the moods of Sims or instantly increase funds were intentionally included by developers to make players feel like they were breaking the game.</p><p>Ants are a poignant metaphor for Wright, who pulled The Sims through a grueling seven-year development process after the Oakland-Berkeley firestorm in 1991 destroyed most of his belongings.</p><p>“When I returned to the ashes of my house, I noticed that the only things still alive were ants,” said Wright, whose insect simulator SimAnt was published that year. “They had burrowed deep into the ground to survive the fire and were living off the dead carcasses of what they could forage.”</p><p>Ants use pheromones to communicate with one another, leaving their intelligence across the environment to mark areas filled with food or predators. Wright wondered: Could human intelligence be distributed in a similar way? Instead of pheromones, The Sims uses objects as behavioral markers (a hungry Sim might be automatically drawn to the fridge). It was a modular approach that allowed designers to expand the game — and its revenue.</p><p>“A long time ago, I decided that game design is applied psychology,” Wright said.</p><p>Even before The Sims was released, developers invited people to create custom content, providing basic programming tools for the invention of in-game furniture. As more players adopted the software, content creators opened websites and offered subscription platforms that provided a steady income.</p><p>“The people who were really invested in the game weren’t even playing The Sims,” Wright said. “They were maintaining websites for the community.”</p><p>It was the beginning of a community-driven phenomenon that continued with The Sims Online in 2002. “A noble failure,” Wright said of the Wild West iteration where players could interact with one another. Users developed new personas, fueling a national debate about the limits of free expression online. Some players operated digital bordellos; others formed mafias.</p><p>“We figured out who the godfather was,” Wright attested as he grabbed his red lighter to fire up another cigarette. “It was the lead homemaker of the Bellagio in Las Vegas.”</p><p>A die-hard community of players have learned to create new rules within the game’s code that go far beyond what Wright imagined. They are largely broken into two factions: the realists and the extremists.</p><p>The realists started with the creation of a financial system that enabled players to apply for debit cards and take bank loans; later modifications included lawn mowing and funeral services. Extremists introduced madcap violence, allowing innocent Sims to be drop-kicked into lightning bolts. Others had their bloody corpses secured behind police tape as journalist Sims described the scene.</p><p>“As much as we have set out to carve spaces particularly for custom content, players will always find some way around,” said Lyndsay Pearson, who was a quality assurance tester on the pets expansion of the original game and now oversees the franchise’s creative design.</p><p>Electronic Arts has indicated that there is no plan for The Sims 5 and that The Sims 4, which was released in 2014 and became free to play in 2022, will continue to be supported with the sale of expansion packs. Recent expansions have allowed Sims to become landlords, horseback riders and cottagecore enthusiasts.</p><p>“We are committed to reinvent what it means to play with life,” Pearson said. “The world keeps changing but there is always something for the Sims to do.”</p><p>Wright left The Sims shortly after its sequel started development, envisioning that the game would evolve into a version of “The Truman Show,” where “the boundaries are as far out as we can make them.” One joke among current players is to create a secret basement of “painting goblins” who are locked into small rooms. Their basic needs are met while they create piles of paintings to sell for the Sims who live above them.</p><p>Wright had since built other universes like Spore, an evolution game where players helped a civilization grow from microbes into galactic emperors, and “Bar Karma,” a television series where viewers pitched the story ideas. His current game project, Proxi, is about transforming personal memories into lifelike characters using artificial intelligence.</p><p>“I never really liked the idea of working on sequels,” Wright said of The Sims. “But I’m happy to see the franchise survive and grow in different directions.”</p><p>The Sims 2, released in 2004, leaned further into narrative. Players could engineer detailed stories for their Sims, who were equipped with aspirations, desires and fears. Neighborhoods were customizable and spun with a spider web of social entanglements that echoed the desperate housewives and cheating husbands seen on reality television.</p><p>One Sim named Don Lothario had a romantic entanglement with multiple women, including Nina and Dina Caliente, two sisters who lived together. Lothario was also planning to marry the daughter of a wealthy family whose matriarch, Bella Goth, had mysteriously disappeared. Players might later discover that Bella was abducted by aliens and deposited in a desert village called Strangetown.</p><p>Zooming into this desert pit stop, gamers might discover an odd Stonehenge on the neighborhood’s outskirts. There among the rocks is a Mount Rushmore-size dedication to Wright, sculpted with glasses so he can watch over players’ creations.</p>', 'images/9_Sims.png', 9, 6, 3, '2025-03-10 14:50:55', '2025-02-16 14:01:48'),

And yet, Willis completed the surprising feat live in front of his peers, to complete surprise and widespread jubilation.</p><p>The story quickly went global and serves as a reminder of one of the best things video games offer — a sense of achievement.</p><p>No matter what you play, there’s always some objective to shoot for. Some leaderboard to fight over. Even when you complete something, you can introduce some difficulty level or challenge to further test your skill and patience.</p><p>Even games like Tetris, which many may not have known had such a competitive scene until Willis, offer players the chance to make history. You don’t have to play or even understand a game to appreciate the dedication on display or the huge joy many of these feats can bring.</p><p>So, what happens if someone decides to take a shortcut to the top? The recent drama that has engulfed the gaming community proves that sincerity and skill still (and will always) matter, no matter who you are.</p><p>Elon Musk and his path to exile</p><p>Elon Musk is no stranger to gaming. The tech mogul regularly shares his love of the industry in articles and podcasts worldwide. He even live-streams his own gameplay on social media, all the while answering questions from viewers.</p><p>More recently, Musk has spoken candidly about his prowess in gaming. On Joe Rogan’s podcast, he mentions how he’s one of the best players in Diablo IV, which requires countless hours of grinding to excel at.</p><p>While the game’s leaderboard affirmed his claims, many gamers couldn’t shake the suspicion - was Musk playing the game himself, or was someone else doing grunt work?</p><p>The crux of the latest drama stems from Musk and Path of the Exile 2, an action RPG in early access since late December. During a live stream of the game, Musk debuted an incredibly well-equipped character set on the game\'s most challenging difficulty.</p><p>Eyebrows were raised on how a CEO of his stature had the free time to make so much progress. Moreover, his confusion at some aspects of the game during his playthrough didn’t reflect that of someone who spent vast chunks of time playing through content.</p><p>It’s almost like someone debuting at the Olympic podium in the Gold position but not knowing what the sport is. And it didn’t take long for streamers and content creators to plant the seeds of doubt in the community.</p><p>Many took to social media asking Musk for proof that the achievements were genuine and that the accounts he plays on come from his own time and effort and not boosted by third-party services.</p><p>These \'accusations’ obviously touched a nerve with Musk, igniting very public social media spats that have gripped the gaming scene for the last few days. Private DMs have been leaked. Scathing posts are now deleted. Accounts were unfollowed, and verification badges were temporarily removed.</p><p>People from Musk’s personal life, such as ex-girlfriend Grimes, sounded in to share insights and reassure the masses of at least some of Musk’s past gaming feats. All the while, gamers readied their popcorn to see just where the debate would rage next.</p><p>For many, Elon Musk\'s gaming habits might seem like a moot point. Given everything else happening in the world, are we really debating his commitment to a video game? Yes, we are. And here’s why.</p><p>Skill will always be the secret weapon in gaming.</p><p>The outrage and comedy of the past week point to larger changes in the gaming industry. It’s now cool to play games. But it’s even cooler to be the best at them – or at least, be seen to be.</p><p>Elon’s boasting about excelling at games that demand hundreds of hours may have been an attempt to curry digital street cred from the gaming community. But it didn’t take long for that bragging to lead to some honest questions.</p><p>Since so many popular games are designed to be endless, with live-service elements that force you to grind relentlessly, key gamers rightfully take their place at the top of the pecking order for their sacrifices.</p><p>They invest a lifetime of work into excelling in specific games. We watch their content to enjoy their level of commitment without the time investment. Sometimes, gamers create unique challenges that bring communities on a journey.</p><p>They might compete using unconventional controllers or impose grueling restrictions on how they play. Other times, they focus on speedrunning, completing entire games as quickly as possible for a chance at a world record or infamy.</p><p>Twitch and YouTube chats are constantly abuzz with viewers cheering, advising, or just lurking for hours. By the end of a stream, whatever achievement is made feels like a collective effort.</p><p>Thinking back to how Willis Gibson broke Tetris, I was amazed to learn that the record-breaker didn\'t just strike lucky in that moment. In an interview with the New York Times, he said he practiced Tetris for about 20 hours weekly. His success was grounded in hard work and dedication. His achievement elevated the Tetris scene and influenced how competitors now play.</p><p>This week proves that allegedly hiring someone to do the hard work is simply a step too far. Fans don’t want the glory of the photo finish; they want to watch everything that leads up to it.</p><p>Elon Musk’s gaming achievements seemed to celebrate one thing – Elon Musk. While he may have admitted to some of the claims in a recent interview, the drama unfolding right now proves that no matter who you are in the gaming world, if you\'re going to skip the hard work, people will skip the celebrations.</p>', 'images/10_ElonMusk_Diablo.webp', 10, 6, 3, '2025-04-07 13:58:47', '2025-02-13 15:02:31'),

(14, 'Stares and ear-twitches: The linguist learning to speak the expressive language of cows', 'Dutch linguist Leonie Cornips has become fascinated with how cows communicate. But can this really be called \'language\'?', '<p>Leonie Cornips was long overdue for her coffee break. The chilly autumn air made a hot drink feel enticing. But Cornips was busy. She was a couple of hours into her work with a small herd of dairy cows. If she left now, she would lose something that would take time to recover. Cornips and the herd had entered a delicate, shared space she calls \"the rhythm of the cow\". </p><p>Cornips is a sociolinguist at the Meertens Institute in Amsterdam in the Netherlands. The scholars who pass through the institute\'s ornate doorway usually specialise in the study of Dutch language and culture. The soft-spoken researcher earned her academic laurels in the 1990s, and she still studies variations in syntax between different dialects in the Netherlands. But in addition to this, Cornips\' work has more recently taken what professionals in the field call \"the animal turn\".</p><p>For years, Cornips has spent her summer holidays on a farm. She was struck from the start by the different personalities of individual cows. She read an essay by a philosopher that asked why linguists never study animals. It affected her deeply. Cornips felt that cows had the intelligence and social habits to be good research subjects for a linguist. As a Dutch person, she also knew they were cultural icons in a nation with a passion for cheese. So she turned her professional skills to cows.</p><p>Humans have assumed for centuries that the ability to use language is a measure of our superiority. There is even an academic term for it: \"logocentrism\", meaning those who use words (from the Greek logos, meaning \"word\" or \"reason\") occupy a privileged position. Language, say many linguists, is what makes us human. Animals may grunt, bark or chirp, but they do not possess anything that counts as language.</p><p>Cornips is using her work with dairy cows to push back on this idea. It extends half a century of effort that began with Jane Goodall\'s work with chimpanzees and Roger Payne\'s recording of humpback whales in the 1960s in an effort to show that humans may not be as linguistically unique as we had assumed.</p><p>Many of Cornips\' colleagues were sceptical when she suggested they apply the framework of linguistics to animals.</p><p>\"The problem is people have no clear idea about language,\" she says. \"When they talk about language, they always refer to what comes out of the mouth.\" But after spending six years thoroughly immersed in the lives of cows, Cornips thinks that language is better understood as \"distributed\" between the mouth, body and surroundings, making it embodied, multi-modal and sensory. \"I\'m eating with the cows, touching, kissing, walking, hugging,\" she says.</p><p>Most research on cow language tend to focus on sounds. A 2015 study in the Netherlands, for example, looked at the pitch of cow sounds to see if they correlated with behaviours and concluded this could be a way to determine their welfare. And a 2019 Australian study found cows not only have distinctive individual vocalisations, but maintain these distinctive calls across a variety of contexts.</p><p>Cornips and the farmers she recruits to assist her record the frequency, duration and intensity of the sounds cows make. But she also focusses on the other ways meaning is expressed among bovines. Her methods are often ethnographic, a way of studying cultures that relies strongly on observation by the researcher. Cornips carefully observes cow behaviours and interactions alongside sound to determine how they communicate. \"I notice with cows that the body is an instrument to get to know the other,\" she says. Recognising this leads Cornips to talk less of \"language\" and more widely of \"languaging practices\".</p><p>Cows, for example, have an elaborate greeting ritual that Cornips must follow to successfully slip into the rhythm of the herd, she says. This became obvious with Piet, a young male Fleckvieh from an intensively managed indoor facility who Cornips brought to join five other cows in an outdoor pasture. </p><p>\"I was always so happy to see him, that when I got into his meadow, I walked straight towards him and tried to touch him immediately,\" Cornips says. When she did so, Piet would back away.</p><p>Cornips gradually came to understand the need to respect Piet\'s personal space, as she might with a fellow human. She learned to keep her arms by her sides and only use eye contact intermittently, taking turns with Piet to look at each other and then look away. \"It took me quite a while,\" she says. \"I was very stupid. They are teaching me how to connect to them.\" Cornips realised she had to learn an etiquette. Without patience and attention, she says, you would never see it.</p><p>Patience also turns out to be crucial when cows communicate with each other. When a mother calls her calf, it sometimes takes 60 seconds for the calf to respond. The space between is filled with bodily gestures. Studies from Austria show that ear positioning and neck-stretching are integral to cow language. Humans think of the ability to wiggle our ears as a party trick. For a cow, it appears to be fundamental to communication. The first sentence in a conversation with a cow is likely to involve movement of the ears and a look.  </p><p>Cows are not the only animals being studied for their complex modes of communication. Michelle Fournet, an assistant professor specialising in marine acoustic ecology at the University of New Hampshire in the US, has learned it is unhelpful to impose human expectations on species like whales and seals.</p><p>Animals use sound completely differently from how humans use it, she says. \"If we are to do a good job at understanding how animals are communicating and why they are communicating, it behoves us to adopt their perspective.\"</p><p>Fournet stops short of using the word \"language\" to describe the information transfer taking place between non-humans. But she has gained a deep appreciation for the subtleties of animal communication. Their system is not less than ours, Fournet says, but other. We do them a disservice by searching for similarities. </p><p>One difference between humans and many animals is their use of the environment. Cornips has found cow communication leans on its surroundings more than ours. She observed one herd where individuals used their bodies to bang on an iron fence to communicate with the rest of the herd at feeding time, which she views as a type of language. She noticed cows responding to her differently depending on whether she entered a barn with solid walls or open sides: since cows on different farms are surrounded by different physical features, this offers distinctive opportunities for linguistic expression. Cows, she argues, develop diverse languaging practices – almost like dialects – where meaning depends on the shape of their surroundings.</p><p>Like other domestic animals, cows face the additional challenge of interspecies communication with humans. \"Most farmers are not sensitive to the rhythm of the cow,\" says Cornips. \"The cows must obey the rhythm of the farmer.\" Dairy herds are constantly shunted between feeding, milking and grazing grounds. If a cow does not learn the daily routine or fails to be productive, it goes to the slaughterhouse. She is shocked by how readily people assume cows are stupid. </p><p>\"In becoming a dairy cow,\" she says, \"they must have very rich communicative skills because they have to understand what the farmer wants them to do… which is not easy.\"</p><p>Cornips has analysed recordings to show that cows will simplify their vocalisation once a farmer recognises their need. Rather than having their intelligence bred out of them to be more compliant, Cornips thinks domestic animals are forced to develop a fuller communication repertoire than wild animals.  </p><p>If dairy cows have complex linguistic practices, it\'s tempting to ask how they stack up against the other great communicators in the animal kingdom. How would they compare, for example, to humpback whales? Cornips admires the complex vocalisations found in whale song. Humpbacks are among the cetaceans known to develop different dialects in different regions. They also communicate over vast distances. (Read more about the sophisticated structures similar to those found in human language which researchers are uncovering in whale communication).</p><p>But Cornips points out that whales lack some of the capacities of cows. A whale\'s ears are not as moveable as a cow\'s, she says. They also lack hooves. \"Whales cannot express themselves bodily very much,\" Cornips says. \"In that way they may be [less complex] than cows.\"</p><p>Fournet says she does not believe it makes sense to rank animal communication by its complexity. \"There isn\'t an answer to what you are looking for,\" she told me when I asked her to compare whales to cows.</p><p>Many traditional linguists are still hesitant to ascribe language to non-humans. Leora Bar-el, a linguistics professor at the University of Montana in the US, is not hostile to the idea of animal language but thinks it worth asking what we gain and what we lose by expanding the definition of language to include cows.</p><p>\"We may lose the fact there is something unique about human language,\" she says. For example, human language permits incredible creativity. Think of the works of Shakespeare. It can also refer to distant events and even reflect back on itself, as language does when it provides a definition.</p><p>But Eva Meijer, author of the essay that first inspired Cornips and the 2018 book Animal Languages, argues such claims can be self-fulfilling. \"What we see as language has been developed by excluding the language of other animals,\" she says. In fact, we define language in a way that makes it easy to deny it to others. Meijer points out the long history of human oppression associated with denying other people their language. She believes that recognising language in animals provides new tools for understanding them and perhaps even for learning how to inhabit the planet more sustainably.</p><p>Cornips, though, does not put an animal rights agenda at the centre of her work. She is focused primarily on expanding the field of linguistics. But the implications are hard to ignore. Cows may have more complex social lives than we thought. Her research reveals numerous additional avenues for exploration. How much does language contribute to distinctive bovine communities and cultures? What sort of planning can cows do with each other? Can they use language to pass on knowledge between generations?</p><p>The answers to these questions could change how we regard the lives of many animals. When 96% of the weight of mammals on earth is made up of humans and domesticated livestock, understanding better what cattle, sheep and chickens are communicating could lead to improved relationships with them, as well as better lives for animals. </p><p>Cornips knows things are unlikely to change fast. Recently, though, she has noticed the idea that animals have language has become more common in academic journals.</p><p>She hopes linguistics can be a tool for unlocking different attitudes. \"My most important goal,\" she says, \"is to show others that you can look with different eyes at a domestic animal.\" </p>', 'images/14_Cows.webp', 14, 5, 7, '2025-03-10 14:50:55', '2025-02-27 10:05:35'),

One of French President Emmanuel Macron\'s officials described the summit to journalists as a \"wake up call\" for France and Europe, adding that the bloc must not let the AI revolution \"pass it by\".</p><p>Other countries also recognise a potential shifting of AI power in the air. India PM Narendra Modi has confirmed his attendance at this summit – having not come to previous gatherings.</p><p>The US is sending some serious firepower as a defensive signal of its own, including Vice President JD Vance, OpenAI chief executive Sam Altman, and Google\'s Sundar Pichai.</p><p>Elon Musk is notably absent from the official guest list, but he will undoubtedly have something to say about it all, whether he\'s there in person or not.</p><p>British Prime Minister Kier Starmer is also reportedly staying away.</p><p>There have been two previous summits, the first held in the UK and the second in South Korea. A lot has happened since the AI world gathered for the first time, on the steps of the historic mansion of Bletchley House, in November 2023, and promised to try to maximise the benefits of AI while minimising the risks. For one thing, half of the global population has been to the polls since then.</p><p>In Bletchley Park, China\'s Vice Minister for Science and Technology, Wu Zhaohui attended. But there were whispers that he was kept at arms length, on the grounds of national security.</p><p>In Paris, by comparison I expect China to be guests of honour. The country is reportedly sending one of its most senior leaders, Ding Xuexiang, a close ally of President Xi JinPing. There\'s also a buzz around whether DeepSeek creator Liang Wenfeng will join him.</p><p>I asked ChatGPT to list some of AI\'s notable milestones since the South Korea summit of May 2024. DeepSeek did not make the cut.</p><p>Of course there is much more to AI than generative AI like both DeepSeek and ChatGPT - tools that create content like text, images, video. It may well be the most widely accessible to us as consumers. But there are also AI tools that spot disease symptoms, model climate change solutions, develop new formulas for drugs - and that will all be in scope in Paris.</p><p>Furthermore, the David v Goliath narrative around which the story of DeepSeek hangs does merit further scrutiny. The boss of AI firm Anthropic, Dario Amodei, has written a compelling blog about whether DeepSeek really was built at a fraction of the cost of its US rivals.</p><p>We do know that it was built on their shoulders: using a number of Nvidia chips (probably older ones, because of US sanctions) and some opensource AI architecture developed by Meta. In addition, OpenAI has complained that rivals are using its work in order to advance their own (contacts in the creative industries were amused at the irony of this, given that OpenAI products will happily produce output \"in the style of\" individual human creators).</p><p>But nonetheless DeepSeek succeeded in shaking up the AI sector in a way not even AI itself might have predicted. And it wiped a lot of money off the value of some of the biggest players in the process. It will almost certainly be a huge topic of conversation all around those Parisian conference rooms.</p><p>There\'s one more theme running through the AI Summit that will be worth keeping an eye on.</p><p>The first summit had the word \"safety\" in its title. Some felt the event pushed the narrative too hard and terrified people with dark talk of existential threats.</p><p>But it hasn\'t fallen of the agenda entirely.</p><p>As a subject, AI safety is a rather broad church. It can relate to any number of risks: the generation and spread of misinformation, displays of bias and discrimination against individuals or races, the ongoing development by multiple countries of AI-controlled weapons, the potential for AI to create unstoppable computer viruses.</p><p>Prof Geoffrey Hinton, often described as one of the Godfathers of AI, says these as \"short-term risks\". They might be up for discussion in Paris, but he argued on BBC Radio 4\'s Today programme last week that they are unlikely to garner strong international collaboration in the long term.</p><p>The big scenario which he believes will really pull everyone together is the prospect of AI becoming more intelligent than humans – and wanting to seize control.</p><p>\"Nobody wants AI to take over from people,\" he says. \"The Chinese would much rather the Chinese Communist Party ran the show than AI.\"</p><p>Prof Hinton compared this eventuality to the height of the Cold War, when the US and Russia \"just about succeeded\" in collaborating in order to prevent global nuclear war.</p><p>\"There\'s no hope of stopping [AI development],\" he said. \"What we\'ve got to do is to try to develop it safely.\"</p><p>Prof Max Tegmark, founder of the Future of Life Institute, also shares a stark warning. \"Either we develop an amazing AI tool that helps humans, or uncontrollable AGI [Artificial General Intelligence] that replaces humans,\" he says.</p><p>\"We are unfortunately closer to building AGI than to figuring out how to control it.\"</p><p>Prof Tegmark hopes the summit will push for binding safety standards \"like we have in every other critical industry\".</p>', 'images/15_AIDomination.webp', 15, 6, 3, '2025-04-07 13:59:17', '2025-02-24 15:30:40'),
(16, 'Six Nordic paintings that can help us rethink winter', 'Winter isn\'t all bad – these \"sublime\" landscapes of the frozen North from the turn of the 20th Century offer us a way into resilience – and an \"acceptance of the seasonality of life\".', '<p>With its bare trees, long nights and icy temperatures, it\'s perhaps unsurprising that, culturally in the Northern Hemisphere, we seem so conditioned to complain about winter. Yet, as the author Katherine May points out in her 2020 book Wintering, winter is also a valuable time for rest and retreat. \"Winter offers us liminal spaces to inhabit,\" she writes. Its \"starkness\", she argues, re-sensitises us, and \"can reveal colours that we would otherwise miss\".</p><p>For Nordic countries, where, in some regions, the season can last more than six months, making peace with winter is a necessity, with concepts such as the Norwegian friluftsliv (embracing the natural world) and the Danish hygge (hunkering down with simple comforts) offering fresh perspectives on cold weather.</p><p>At the turn of the 20th Century, the frozen North – with its vast fjords, mystical boreal forests and radiant light – became a powerful muse for artists such as Hilma af Klint, Edvard Munch and Harald Sohlberg. These artists immersed themselves in these cold climates, and developed a specifically Nordic style of painting imbued with their emotional responses to the landscape. Around 70 of these intensely atmospheric, expressionist works by artists from Scandinavia, Finland and Canada are being showcased in a new exhibition, Northern Lights, a cross-Atlantic collaboration that debuts at the Fondation Beyeler in Basel, Switzerland, before travelling to New York\'s Buffalo AKG Art Museum in August.</p><p>It was natural that these painters should be drawn to these wintery scenes, Ulf Küster, the exhibition\'s curator, tells the BBC. \"In Nordic landscapes, snow is a very dominant factor of life from October to late April… It\'s just this massive presence of white and nature and wilderness and vastness that really defines this landscape, and I think these painters have found a very interesting response to that.\" This burst of Nordic landscape painting was also a response to the changes that the painters perceived as a result of population growth and industrialisation. \"There was a big desire in the late 19th Century to return to pure nature and the simple life,\" explains Küster. \"You had these highly industrialised countries and pollution, and the pureness of white snow must have been quite a contrast.\"  </p><p>Many of these northern regions were comparatively untouched by change, and featured vast, unpopulated vistas that were inherently painterly. Even today, Norway has a population of just 5.5 million, but a length of around 1,600km; while around three-quarters of Finland is still forested. To convey this scale, these paintings often adopt unconventional compositions where the view appears to stretch beyond the canvas. They are \"boundless\", says Küster. \"They don\'t have borders\". This is reinforced by the bird\'s-eye view adopted in works such as View from Pyynikki Ridge (1900) by the Finnish artist Helmi Biese. \"It\'s as if the artists have used a drone,\" remarks Küster.</p><p>The height and scope of these unpopulated views also convey a sense of isolation and loneliness. Harald Sohlberg, whose luminescent 1914 version of Winter Night in the Mountains is widely considered to be the national painting of Norway, wrote: \"The longer I stood gazing at the scene, the more I seemed to feel what a solitary and pitiful atom I was in an endless universe… It was as if I had suddenly awakened in a new, unimagined and inexplicable world… Above the white contours of a northern winter stretched the endless vault of heaven, twinkling with myriads of stars. It was like a service in some vast cathedral.\" </p><p>It was this search for solitude that doubtless drew the Swedish artist Anna Boberg to the Norwegian archipelago of Lofoten, a remote location steeped in Viking folklore and, according to her 1901 memoir, \"the apotheosis of Arctic beauty and wilderness\". It was here, dressed head-to-toe in seal and reindeer fur, that she produced her Northern Lights (1901) painting, most likely sketched en plein air. In a commanding scene that speaks to the Romantic notion of \"the sublime\", prismatic streaks of light descend from the heavens dwarfing the snowy landscape.</p><p>Boberg\'s awe when confronted with this dazzling wintry world with its unique light is clear. \"What really drove these people was to find a response to the extremities of nature – the very essence of snow, winter and ice.\" explains Küster. To achieve this, they would \"get as close to nature as possible\", he says. Far from hiding from the harsh winter, Boberg and her contemporaries immersed themselves in the landscape. \"They are painters who really wanted to paint the experience, to feel the extreme temperature and the snow blindness,\" says Küster. Munch, he continues, had outdoor studios, and would leave his paintings outside \"just to let nature test them\", while some of the Canadian painters would paddle out on to lakes and paint from their canoes.  </p><p>Inland, the boreal forest embodied the enchanting duality of these landscapes, which were both beautiful and barbaric. The dark, primeval forests became an emblem of foreboding in Nordic folklore and myth – places where you could get lost, and that concealed unknown dangers. The Nordic winter landscape fed the fairytales of the Danish author Hans Christian Andersen. \"Below them the wind blew cold, wolves howled, and black crows screamed as they skimmed across the glittering snow,\" he writes in The Snow Queen (1844). \"But up above, the moon shone bright and large.\"</p><p>This storybook quality can be seen in Winter Moonlight (1895) by the Swedish painter Gustaf Fjaestad. Here, his clever use of pointillism makes the snow appear to glitter, while the hand-like branches of the dense, drooping trees look poised to come alive. In The Lair of the Lynx (1908), Akseli Gallen-Kallela, a Finn, also revels in this tantalising, darker side to the landscape, inviting us to scan the canvas for the dark places beasts may be lurking, and to follow their tracks in the snow.</p><p>Notable, also, is the power and movement he gives to the snow as it winds in thick layers around the trees. \"The brushwork of this painting meticulously reacts to the layers of snow,\" says Küster. \"It\'s snowing, then it\'s freezing, there might be some sun and there\'s a little thaw, and then there\'s freezing again and more snow comes on top.\" The painter is clearly entranced by the snow, the layers of paint telling the snow\'s story. The visual effect, observes Küster, is \"like a sort of wedding cake\".</p><p>As well as drawing inspiration from the landscape\'s mythical associations, these artists participated in their own myth-making, expressing – through their own strong emotional responses to these unspoilt regions – an often idealised view of the Nordic winter. Some, such as Edvard Munch, nevertheless hinted at the changes threatening these serene expanses. During the winter of 1900, he stayed in Nordstrand on the banks of the Oslofjord. Here he painted his now-famous rendition of its serene waters reflecting a magnificent sky of pink, blue and yellow. But this picturesque, swirling scene, foregrounded by pines, is interrupted by a bulbous trail of white paint, denoting, not snow this time, but, as the title makes clear, Train Smoke.</p><p>\"When we look back at the landscape works of Gallen-Kallela and Biese, we are reminded of how much of the environment has changed in the intervening century,\" writes Anna-Maria Pennonen in her essay Changing Landscapes in the exhibition catalogue. \"The Baltic Sea no longer freezes every winter, and the period when the ground is covered with snow in Helsinki can be very short, perhaps only a few weeks instead of months.\" As for the magnificent boreal forest, it continues to be threatened by logging and agriculture.</p><p>Recognising the mutability of these environments now adds a powerful new dimension when a modern audience engages with these 100-year-old works. \"They ask us to think about the enchanting image of the forest in relation to its past and current transformation, as well as in relation to our own part therein,\" writes Helga Christoffersen in the catalogue. The works invite feelings of nostalgia and melancholy, and our appreciation that they are endangered only amplifies their beauty and psychological intensity.</p><p>Danish artist Jakob Kudsk Steensen, born in 1987, addresses this issue of climate change in Boreal Dreams (2024), an interactive, immersive work and online experience, commissioned for Northern Lights. The work uses virtual reality to connect past, present and future boreal ecosystems. It takes visitors on a journey into five imagined futures for the boreal forest, marrying technology with environmental data to create a visceral experience of nature.

Devon Van Houten Maldonado reveals how a crushed bug became a sign of wealth and status.', '<p>Although scarlet is the colour of sin in the Old Testament, the ancient world’s elite was thirsty for red, a symbol of wealth and status. They spent fantastic sums searching for ever more vibrant hues, until Hernán Cortés and the conquistadors discovered an intoxicatingly saturated pigment in the great markets of Tenochtitlan, modern-day Mexico City. Made from the crushed-up cochineal insect, the mysterious dye launched Spain toward its eventual role as an economic superpower and became one of the New World’s primary exports, as a red craze descended on Europe. An exhibition at Mexico City’s Palacio de Bellas Artes museum reveals the far-reaching impact of the pigment through art history, from the renaissance to modernism.</p><p>In medieval and classical Europe, artisans and traders tripped over each other in search of durable saturated colors and – in turn – wealth, amid swathes of weak and watery fabrics. Dyers guilds guarded their secrets closely and performed seemingly magical feats of alchemy to fix colours to wool, silk and cotton. They used roots and resins to create satisfactory yellows, greens and blues. The murex snail was crushed into a dye to create imperial purple cloth worth more than its weight in gold. But truly vibrant red remained elusive.</p><p>For many years, the most common red in Europe came from the Ottoman Empire, where the ‘Turkey red’ process used the root of the rubia plant. European dyers tried desperately to reproduce the results from the East, but succeeded only partially, as the Ottoman process took months and involved a pestilent mix of cow dung, rancid olive oil and bullocks’ blood, according to Amy Butler Greenfield in her book, A Perfect Red.</p><p>Dyers also used Brazilwood, lac and lichens, but the resulting colours were usually underwhelming, and the processes often resulted in brownish or orange reds that faded quickly. For royalty and elite, St John’s Blood and Armenian red (dating back as far as the 8th Century BCE, according to Butler Greenfield), created the most vibrant saturated reds available in Europe until the 16th Century. But, made from different varieties of Porphyrophora root parasites, their production was laborious and availability was scarce, even at the highest prices.</p><p>Mesoamerican peoples in southern Mexico had started using the cochineal bug as early as 2000 BCE, long before the arrival of the conquistadors, according to Mexican textile expert Quetzalina Sanchez. Indigenous people in Puebla, Tlaxcala and Oaxaca had systems for breeding and engineering the cochineal bugs for ideal traits and the pigment was used to create paints for codices and murals, to dye cloth and feathers, and even as medicine.</p><p>When the conquistadors arrived in Mexico City, the headquarters of the Aztec empire, the red colour was everywhere. Outlying villages paid dues to their Aztec rulers in kilos of cochineal and rolls of blood-red cloth. “Scarlet is the colour of blood and the grana from cochineal achieved that [...] the colour always had a meaning, sometimes magic other times religious,” Sanchez told the BBC.</p><p>Cortés immediately recognized the riches of Mexico, which he related in several letters to King Charles V. “I shall speak of some of the things I have seen, which although badly described, I know very well will cause such wonder that they will hardly be believed, because even we who see them here with our own eyes are unable to comprehend their reality,” wrote Cortés to the king. About the great marketplace of Tenochtitlan, which was “twice as large as that of Salamanca,\" he wrote, “They also sell skeins of different kinds of spun cotton in all colours, so that it seems quite like one of the silk markets of Granada, although it is on a greater scale; also as many different colours for painters as can be found in Spain and of as excellent hues.”</p><p>First-hand accounts indicate that Cortés wasn’t overly smitten with cochineal, more concerned instead with plundering gold and silver. Back in Spain, the king was pressed to make ends meet and hold together his enormous dominion in relative peace, so, although he was at first unconvinced by the promise of America, he became fascinated by the exotic tales and saw in cochineal an opportunity to prop up the crown’s coffers. By 1523, cochineal pigment made its way back to Spain and caught the attention of the king who wrote to Cortés about exporting the dyestuff back to Europe, writes Butler.</p><p>“Through absurd laws and decrees [the Spanish] monopolised the grana trade,” says Sanchez. “They obligated the indians to produce as much as possible.” The native Mesoamericans who specialised in the production of the pigment and weren’t killed by disease or slaughtered during the conquest were paid pennies on the dollar – while the Spaniards “profited enormously as intermediaries.”</p><p>Dye from the cochineal bug was ten times as potent as St John’s Blood and produced 30 times more dye per ounce than Armenian red, according to Butler. So when European dyers began to experiment with the pigment, they were delighted by its potential. Most importantly, it was the brightest and most saturated red they had ever seen. By the middle of the 16th Century it was being used across Europe, and by the 1570s it had become one of the most profitable trades in Europe – growing from a meagre “50,000 pounds of cochineal in 1557 to over 150,000 pounds in 1574,” writes Butler.</p><p>In the Mexican Red exhibition at the Palacio de Bellas Artes, the introduction of cochineal red to the European palette is illustrated in baroque paintings from the beginning of the 17th Century, after the pigment was already a booming industry across Europe and the world. Works by baroque painters like Cristóbal de Villalpando and Luis Juárez, father of José Juárez, who worked their entire lives in Mexico (New Spain), hang alongside the Spanish-born Sebastián López de Arteaga and the likes of Peter Paul Rubens.</p><p>López de Arteaga’s undated work The Incredulity of Saint Thomas pales in comparison to Caravaggio’s version of the same work, where St Thomas’s consternation and amazement is palpable in the skin of his furrowed forehead. But the red smock worn by Christ in López de Arteaga’s painting, denoting his holiness, absolutely pops off the canvas. Both artists employed cochineal, the introduction of which helped to establish the dramatic contrast that characterised the baroque style.</p><p>A few steps away, a portrait of Isabella Brandt (1610) by Rubens shows the versatility of paint made from cochineal. The wall behind the woman is depicted in a deep, glowing red, from which she emerges within a slight aura of light. The bible in her hand was also rendered in exquisite detail from cochineal red in Rubens’ unmistakable mastery of his brush, which makes his subjects feel as alive as if they were in front of you.</p><p>Moving forward toward modernism – it wasn’t until the middle of the 19th Century that cochineal was replaced by synthetic alternatives as the pre-eminent red dyestuff in the world – impressionist painters continued to make use of the heavenly red hues imported from Mexico. At the Palacio de Bellas Artes, works by Paul Gauguin, Auguste Renoir and Vincent van Gogh have all been analysed and tested positive for cochineal. Like Rubens, Renoir’s subjects seem to be alive on the canvas, but as an impressionist his portraits dissolved into energetic abstractions. Gauguin also used colour, especially red, to create playful accents, but neither compared to the saturation achieved by Van Gogh. His piece, The Bedroom (1888), on loan from the Art Institute of Chicago, puts a full stop on the exhibition with a single burning-hot spot of bright red.</p><p>After synthetic pigments became popular, outside of Mexico, the red dye was mass-produced as industrial food colouring – its main use today. Yet while the newly independent Mexico no longer controlled the valuable monopoly on cochineal, it also got something back – the sacred red that had been plundered and proliferated by the Spanish. “In Europe, as has happened in many cases, the history of the original people of Mexico has mattered very little,” Sanchez told the BBC, but in Mexico “the colour continues to be associated with ancestral magic [and] protects those who wear attire dyed with cochineal.”</p>', 'images/17_RedInsect.webp', 17, 3, 8, '2025-03-10 14:50:55', '2025-02-02 12:08:04'),

Stare for longer than a minute and these disconnected shapes begin to form new connections and meanings in the mind\'s eye.</p><p>\"Appreciating Dalí\'s art is like peeling back the layers of an onion; you can keep finding something new to marvel at,\" Ms Argillet says.</p><p>Bringing Dalí\'s work to India was a long and arduous endeavour, says Akshitta Aggarwal of Bruno Art Group, the international art gallery presenting the exhibition.</p><p>\"The project took five years; every sketch and artwork had to be checked for its authenticity,\" Ms Aggarwal says.</p><p>Strictly speaking, this isn\'t the first time Dalí\'s creations have come to India. The Victoria Memorial Hall in Kolkata city holds two colour etchings of the artist.</p><p>In 1967, Dalí famously designed a set of whimsical ashtrays for Air India - the country\'s national airline back then - which were handed out to first class passengers.</p><p>In return, Dalí demanded not money but a baby elephant. Uttara Parikh, the then deputy commercial director of Air India, recounted to Times of India newspaper how she initially went shopping for one in a zoo in Mumbai city but returned empty-handed.</p><p>She finally procured the baby elephant from a zoo in Bangalore city (now Bengaluru) and Air India flew the animal to Spain, where it was kept in a zoo until its death in 2018. (Dalí had exciting plans for the elephant, such as undertaking a journey across the Alps, but his wife dissuaded him from attempting to carry them out).</p><p>Dalí\'s demand might seem outrageous, but those familiar with the artist and his legacy know that it was very much in keeping with his personality.</p><p>Born in Spain in 1904, Dalí grew up in a world that was embracing the avant-garde and responding to the fallout of two world wars. Creatives of his time, like Pablo Picasso, Joan Miró and André Breton, were finding new ways to express themselves and their ideas and their artistic styles heavily influenced a young Dalí.</p><p>The surrealist movement, widely acknowledged to be founded by André Breton, resonated with him the most. Surrealist art advocated for a form of expression that was \"dictated by thought, in the absence of any control exercised by reason\", according to Breton.</p><p>Dalí was also heavily inspired by Sigmund Freud and his theories around psychoanalysis - a method of treating mental illnesses by focussing on conflicts originating in a person\'s psyche. Dreams take on a special importance as they are believed to express a person\'s repressed thoughts and urges.</p><p>Consequently, Dalí\'s art reflects many of these ideas - they have an almost dream-like quality and through free association, the visuals take on meanings that are unique to the onlooker. There is also visceral, almost shocking imagery, much like forbidden desires lying hidden in the subconscious mind.</p><p>\"Dalí was a free-thinker and he embraced all facets of the human condition, particularly the taboo and unsettling ones,\" Ms Argillet says.</p><p>The artist\'s outward persona reflected his colourful take on life. He dressed in flamboyant suits and sported a moustache that pointed upward so severely it seemed in danger of piercing his eyes. In a 1955 interview with the BBC, Dalí revealed the origins of his famous upturned moustache.</p><p>\"Dates, you know the fruit? In the last moment of dinner, I [did] not clean my finger and I put a little in my moustache and it remains for all afternoon very efficiently,\" he said but later revealed that he used a strong wax to shape his moustache.</p><p>In the same interview, he described his moustache as being \"very gay, very pointed, very aggressive\".</p><p>Ms Argillet, who knew Dalí intimately through her childhood and teenage years and often spent her summers in Spain with her father, recollects Dalí being a humorous person who loved playing pranks and \"shocking the bourgeois\".</p><p>He once encouraged her to take some sweets from his bedroom and throw them at fishermen at a nearby beach. Only the sweets turned out to be cherry bombs, annoying the fishermen and forcing a young Ms Argillet to run for cover.</p><p>\"At one of his parties, he had a tortoise carry around an ashtray on its shell,\" Ms Argillet says.</p><p>But she adds that he was also a shy, intuitive, observant person who had a knack for reading people\'s minds. He painted in his studio in short pants and slippers and, according to Ms Argillet, it was Dalí\'s shyness that made him over-perform in public.</p><p>\"He was misunderstood by many. There were many layers to Dalí, just like his paintings,\" Ms Argillet says.</p><p>\"The closer you look at his paintings, the more you understand Dalí.\"</p><p>The exhibition \'Dali comes to India\' will be held at the India Habitat Centre from 7 February to 13 February and at Masarrat Gallery by Bruno Art Group from 15 February to 16 March.</p>', 'images\\21_Dali', 21, 3, 3, '2025-02-25 12:11:01', '2025-02-27 16:30:01');
